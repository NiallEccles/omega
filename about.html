        <p>Hi, my name is Niall Eccles.</p>

        <p>I am a web designer/developer from Dublin, Ireland.</p>

        <p>My CV can be found <a href="Niall Eccles CV.pdf" target="_blank">here,</a> with my relevant experience.</p>

        <p>One thing I love about working in this industry is the learning. I never feel like I'm finished learning about a
          new framework or library. This learning is constantly pushing me to become a better designer and developer.</p>

        <p>My first design experience was when I was 15. I was asked to create a set of posters for some gigs along with various
          other artwork. I never had a drive to go into web until I took part in a program at DCU that taught secondary school
          students basic web development. Creating websites really spoke to me and interested me.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="large-12 medium-12 columns">

                <p>This factored into my college choices. I studied Creative Digital Media at the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown.
                   There, I learned a wealth of information that spans photography to web. I was most interested in the web modules
                   such as Web Development 1 & 2, Web Design 1 & 2, Mulitmedia Development 1, Content Management Systems,
                   Application Design and Development, UX Design.</p>

                <p>During my third year of college I had the opportunity to go on work placement in a web company as
                  part of my work experience. The comapny was called Enhace.ie and is owned by Granite. While I was there I was
                  responsible for updating exisiting websites, ensuring websites were built to the design and testing.</p>
